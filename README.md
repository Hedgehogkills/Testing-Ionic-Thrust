Parts Used: 
Arduino UNO
HX711 module
10kg tensometer

Description:
C++ code reads data from tensometer and sends it to the serial monitor where the Python code 
processes and interprets whats in the serial monitor and uses the google API to send it out 
to a google sheet to log the data from the tensometer. (Kind of a run on sentence but thats 
the idea)
